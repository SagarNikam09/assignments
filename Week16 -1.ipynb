    "### Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree Classifier**:\n",
    "- A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**:\n",
    "1. **Root Node**:\n",
    "   - The algorithm starts at the root node, which represents the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting**:\n",
    "   - At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into subsets with the most homogeneous classes. Common criteria for splitting include Gini impurity or information gain (entropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Nodes**:\n",
    "   - Based on the chosen feature, the data is split into branches, leading to child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Leaf Nodes**:\n",
    "   - The process continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf), resulting in leaf nodes that make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction**:\n",
    "   - For a new instance, the decision tree traverses from the root to a leaf node based on feature values and outputs the class label of the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Easy to interpret and visualize.\n",
    "- Handles both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n"

    "### Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Data Splitting**:\r\n",
    "   - At each node, the goal is to split the dataset in a way that best separates the classes. This is done by choosing the feature that results in the greatest information gain or the lowest Gini impurity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Information Gain**:\r\n",
    "   - Information gain measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) after a dataset is split. It is calculated as the difference between the entropy of the parent node and the weighted average entropy of the child nodes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Gini Impurity**:\r\n",
    "   - Gini impurity measures the impurity of a dataset. It calculates the probability of a randomly chosen element being misclassified if it were labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Choosing the Best Split**:\r\n",
    "   - The feature that provides the highest information gain or the lowest Gini impurity is selected for splitting.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Recursive Partitioning**:\r\n",
    "   - The splitting process is repeated recursively on each child node, creating a tree structure until stopping criteria are met.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Stopping Criteria**:\r\n",
    "   - The growth of the tree stops based on criteria like maximum depth, minimum number of samples required to split, or no improvement in impurity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Outcome**:\r\n",
    "- The decision tree partitions the feature space into regions corresponding to different class labels.\r\n"

    "   - Start with a dataset consisting of features and a binary target variable.\r\n",

    "2. **Building the Tree**:\r\n",
    "   - The decision tree algorithm selects features and thresholds to split the data into two classes at each node, optimizing the split based on metrics like information gain or Gini impurity.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Recursive Splitting**:\r\n",
    "   - The tree is grown by recursively splitting nodes into two branches until stopping criteria are met.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Leaf Nodes**:\r\n",
    "   - Each leaf node represents a final decision and corresponds to one of the binary classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Prediction**:\r\n",
    "   - For a new instance, the tree is traversed from the root to a leaf node based on feature values, and the class label of the leaf node is assigned as the prediction.\r\n",

    "**Advantages**:\r\n",
    "- Decision trees can model non-linear relationships and interactions between features.\r\n",
