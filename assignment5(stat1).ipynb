This data is nominal because it is classified into two mutually exclusive categories: male and female. The level of measurement of this data is nominal, so you can only use descriptive statistics to analyze it. For example, you could calculate the percentage of males in the dataset.\n",

This data is ordinal because it can be ranked in order, but the difference between the values is not meaningful. The level of measurement of this data is ordinal, so you can use both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze it. For example, you could calculate the mean satisfaction score or conduct a t-test to compare the satisfaction scores of two groups of people.\n",
    "3) **Interval data:** Suppose you have a dataset that contains the temperature in degrees Celsius of a group of cities. This data is interval because it can be ranked in order, and the difference between the values is meaningful. However, there is no true zero point. The level of measurement of this data is interval, so you can use both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze it. For example, you could calculate the mean temperature or conduct a correlation analysis to see if there is a relationship between the temperature and the number of people who visit a city.\n",
    "4) **Ratio data:** Suppose you have a dataset that contains the weight in kilograms of a group of people. This data is ratio because it has all the properties of interval data, plus there is a true zero point. The level of measurement of this data is ratio, so you can use all types of statistical analysis on it. For example, you could calculate the mean weight, the standard deviation, or the correlation between the weight and the height of the people in the dataset."
