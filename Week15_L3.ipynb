    "### Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Precision**:\r\n",
    "- Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. It answers the question, \"Of all the instances classified as positive, how many are actually positive?\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Recall (Sensitivity)**:\r\n",
    "- Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. It answers the question, \"Of all the actual positive instances, how many were correctly identified by the model?\"\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Key Differences**:\r\n",
    "- Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall focuses on capturing all possible positive cases. High precision means fewer false positives, and high recall means fewer false negatives.\r\n"

    "\r\n",
    "**F1 Score**:\r\n",
    "- The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single measure. It is particularly useful when you need a balance between precision and recall, especially in cases where there is an imbalance between positive and negative classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Difference from Precision and Recall**:\r\n",

    "- The ROC curve is a graphical representation that shows the performance of a classification model at various threshold settings. It plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
