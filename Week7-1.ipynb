    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It is used to gather data from the web in a structured format, which can then be analyzed or used for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three areas where web scraping is used to get data are:\n",
    "1. **E-commerce**: For price comparison and market research.\n",
    "2. **Real Estate**: To collect property listings and market trends.\n",
    "3. **Social Media**: To analyze trends, sentiments, and user interactions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2]\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Different methods used for web scraping include:\n",
    "1. **HTML Parsing**: Using libraries like Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of web pages.\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping Frameworks**: Using frameworks like Scrapy to build spiders that navigate and scrape websites.\n",
    "3. **Browser Automation**: Using tools like Selenium to simulate browser interactions and scrape dynamic content.\n",
    "4. **API Calls**: Accessing data through provided APIs, which is a more reliable and ethical way to get data.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3]\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used because it simplifies the process of web scraping by providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4]\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Flask is used in this web scraping project because it is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It helps in:\n",
    "1. Creating web applications to serve the scraped data.\n",
    "2. Providing a user interface to trigger and display scraping results.\n",
    "3. Integrating with other services and handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently.\n",
