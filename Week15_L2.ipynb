    "\r\n",
    "**Purpose**: Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is used to systematically explore a predefined set of hyperparameters to find the best model configuration. It evaluates model performance using cross-validation to ensure that the results are robust and not overfitting to a particular train-test split.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**How it works**:\r\n",
    "1. Define a grid of hyperparameters and their possible values.\r\n",
    "2. For each combination of hyperparameters, perform cross-validation:\r\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.\r\n",
    "   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate it on the validation set.\r\n",
    "3. Calculate the average performance metric for each hyperparameter comb= grid_search.best_params_\r\n"
