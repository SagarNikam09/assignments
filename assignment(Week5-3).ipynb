    "\n",
    "* **Increased performance:** Multithreading can improve the performance of programs by allowing them to do multiple things at the same time. This can be especially beneficial for programs that perform long-running tasks, such as image processing or database queries.\n",
    "* **Improved responsiveness:** Multithreading can also improve the responsiveness of programs by allowing them to respond to user input more quickly. This is because multiple threads can be running at the same time, so the program does not have to wait for one thread to finish before it can start processing user input.\n",
    "* **Reduced resource usage:** Multithreading can also reduce resource usage by allowing multiple threads to share the same resources, such as CPU time and memory. This can be beneficial for programs that are running on limited resources, such as mobile devices or embedded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complexity:** Multithreaded programs can be more complex to develop and debug than single-threaded programs. This is because the programmer needs to be aware of the potential for race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "* **Concurrency problems:** Multithreaded programs are susceptible to concurrency problems, such as race conditions and deadlocks. Race conditions occur when two or more threads are accessing the same data at the same time and the results of the operation depend on the order in which the threads access the data. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to finish, and this results in a situation where no thread can progress.\n",
    "* **Scheduling overhead:** The operating system needs to schedule the threads to run on the CPU. This can add overhead, which can reduce the performance of the program.\n"

    "**Race condition** is a situation in which the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads access shared data.

If the threads access the variable in different orders, the final value of the variable will be different."
