    "### Q1. In order to predict house price based on several characteristics, such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., you are developing an SVM regression model. Which regression metric in this situation would be the best to employ?\r\n",

    "**Best Metric**:\r\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** would be the best metric in this situation. \r\n",

It’s particularly useful when you need an easily understandable metric that reflects the actual dollar difference between predicted and actual house prices.\r\n"
